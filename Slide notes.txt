Slide 1
- Core of our solution is AI and Cognitive Services specfically those provided by the Azure platfrom
	- This allows us to do really smart thing very rapidly
	- The abilities our solution required the ability to recognise Speech recocnition and to convert that the speech to text
	- But the real heart of it was the use of LUIS and bots, cloud infrastructure.  
	- Using Luis which stands for Language Understanding Intelligence service. We were able to define intents, entities and actions relativley quickly, 
	and then we could use Luis's machine learning ability to train it to understand different turns of phrases and speech quirks
	
- When we looked at our problem statement, we saw that the botframework gave us a very powerfull way to interat and direct the conversation with the users

Slide 2
- The reason to use the bots were its integration with LUIS made it easy for the BOT to act on LUIS understanding of our speech.  
- The bots would understand the intent and start a dialog flow i.e. Book Order, or querying your holings
- Finally, bots had built in integration to multiple channels
- Got some live demos later, but here is a quick video of Our first channel integration into Skype 
	- it will demonstates how the bot can direct the conversation 
- here is a quick video of integrating to cortana for speech
